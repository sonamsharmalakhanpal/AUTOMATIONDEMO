Generate Playwright tests for:

Open the target web application at [URL].
Log in using valid credentials provide in git hub co pilot prompt/message at run time.
Perform the following actions:
[Describe each user action, e.g., click a button, fill a form, select a dropdown, upload a file, etc.]
Validate the expected outcomes:
[List assertions, e.g., check for success messages, verify page navigation, ensure data is displayed correctly, etc.]
Include setup and teardown steps if necessary.
Use clear selectors and comments for maintainability.
Ensure the test is idempotent and can run multiple times without side effects.

For all the above steps generate playwrigth and Typescript test for it in POM(Page Object Model) framework, keep elements idetifiers and methods on different page and testcases seperately
Do run steps one by one using the tools provided by the playwright-mcp
Try to use common unique identfiers for different webelements so that scripts will get stable and not fail due to unidentified elements or webelements not found
only after all the steps are completed and pass emit a playwright Typescript test.
Save generated test file in the test directory
Execute the test file and iterate untill the test passes
